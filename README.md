## Mentors

## Objectives

- [x] Clone the Rustls
- [ ] Find the commonality between WASI-crypto and ring and try to design wasi_crypto_ringified that simulates ring.
  - [ ] List out the APIs that I can use directly.
- ~~ I will just open up a new issue to draw rustls folk's attention.~~
  - [ ] Share my ideas with Dirkjan. Since he replied to my email, I'll try to contact him in priority seeking more advice. Including the insights, I received above.
  - [ ] Refine my design if any new ideas come out.
- [x] Figure out how to test HTTPS in WasmEdge or how we wish it to be like. (test in WASI-crypto will be a nice example)
